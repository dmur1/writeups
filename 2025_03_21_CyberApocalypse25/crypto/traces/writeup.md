# Traces (crypto)

Long ago, a sacred message was sealed away, its meaning obscured by the overlapping echoes of its own magic. The careless work of an enchanter has left behind a flawâ€”a weakness hidden within repetition. With keen eyes and sharper wits, can you untangle the whispers of the past and restore the lost words?

## Analysis

We can see from the following code that this code encrypts messages using AES in CTR mode but with nonce reuse:

```python
def output_message(self, msg):
    enc_body = self.encrypt(msg.encode()).hex()
    print(enc_body, flush=True)
    sleep(0.001)

def encrypt(self, msg):
    encrypted_message = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=Counter.new(128)).encrypt(msg)
    return encrypted_message
```

This means that if we have any known plaintext for any of the given ciphertext that we can recover a portion of the keystream for all of the ciphertexts.

The task presents something like an IRC server.

Join "#general" and you will see a bunch of ciphertext encrypted with `encrypt`.

We can see from the following code that before people can talk in a channel they must provide "!nick " followed by their nickname:

```python
warn('You must set your channel nickname in your first message at any channel. Format: "!nick <nickname>"')
```

This means that if we know the nickname that a user input that we have a good chunk of known plaintext.

We can see from the output that user "Runeblight" has the longest name and they wrote something in the third message. If we guess that its "!nick Runeblight" we can then try to recover the first 16 bytes of the keystream as follows:

```python
p.readuntil(b"<Runeblight> : ")
c = bytes.fromhex(p.readline().decode())
k = xor(b"!nick Runeblight", cc)
print(f"{k.hex() = }")
```

If this guess was correct - which it is - we can now recover the first 16 bytes of plaintext from every message for which we have ciphertext.

The keystream can now be extended by crib dragging. That is by making educated guesses about the plaintext of messages and trialing them in keystream recover we can slowly extend our keystream.

For example if we saw a message like "I'll com" we can guess that the plaintext is actually "I'll compare " and if we guessed correctly we can recover an additional 5 bytes of the keystream.

If you guess incorrectly its very likely that most of the other messages will look nonsensical (or contain non-printable bytes in the resulting plaintext in the context of ascii strings in a chat app).

For more information on crib dragging (and known-plaintext attacks in general) see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack.

## Solution

1) Join #general and read a bunch of ciphertexts
2) Recover the start of the keystream by using known-plaintext
3) Crib drag to extend the keystream
4) Recover the password from one of the messages
5) Use the password to join #secret
6) Crib drag to extend the keystream
7) Recover the flag from one of the messages
